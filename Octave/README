Mars Mission
============

This is the code developed to compute trajectories to and from Mars from earth;
it also finds the trajectories required to land on the surface of mars.

In this folder, there are two self-sufficient programs: "final.m" and
"iterate.m".

final.m
=======
Holds the main code, and can find the trajectories between two points. It takes
no command line arguments, so the angle of departure and arrival and both to and
from earth must be explicitly provided in the code itself. It also finds the
change in velocities needed to achieve the transfer orbits. These can then be
used in "massRatio.m" to find the initial mass of the spacecraft departing from
low earth orbit.

massRatio.m
===========
This file also takes no arguments; it takes the different changes in velocity
for each portion of the orbit and the final mass expected to have at the end of
the trip (as well as the masses of different rockets), and returns the initial
mass.

iterate.m
=========
This is a modification of final.m that can be used to calculate random
different transfer orbits from a range of arrival and departure angles. It does
require that arguments be supplied from the command line. See multiThread.sh for
the method of doing so.
